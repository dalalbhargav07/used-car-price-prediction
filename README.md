# used-car-price-prediction

The main aim of this case study to intiate the data science process starting with:
1. Data Collection
2. Data cleaning & pre-proccessing
3. Exploratory data analysis and visualizations
4. Data modelling
5. Evaluating the model
6. Saving the model

Once, the model is saved, it was ready to deploy it on the server and later the saved model can be used as API. The API was developed in python/flask framework.
